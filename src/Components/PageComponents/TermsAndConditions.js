      <h1>TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS</h1>
      <h2>ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h2>
      <p>
        By creating a Maidaan account, you’re agreeing to these terms as well as
        any additional terms of use by our partners.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Service is offered subject to acceptance without modification of all
        of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating
        rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to time
        on the Mobile applications and Sites by Maidaan. In addition, some
        services offered through the Service may be subject to additional terms
        and conditions promulgated by Maidaan from time to time; your use of
        such services is subject to those additional terms and conditions, which
        are incorporated into these Terms of Use by this reference. You
        represent and warrant that if you are an individual, you are of legal
        age to agree to these terms and conditions or you have your parents’
        permission to do so, and that all registration information you submit
        (including any details you submit for a parent or guardian) is accurate
        and truthful. Maidaan may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer the
        Service to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at
        any time. This provision is void where prohibited by law and the right
        to access the Service is revoked in such jurisdictions.

        information), may be transferred unencrypted and involve (a)
        transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and

      <h2>RULES AND CONDUCT</h2>
      <p>
        This section lists stuff you know you shouldn’t do: breaking laws,

        way.
      </p>
